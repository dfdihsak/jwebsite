## What I Do In A High-Level, Non-Resume Sense
I am a full-stack software engineer with most of my experience in infra. You can think of that as the backend of things; even when I worked on Frontend Infra at Slack it was really like the backend of the frontend. I appreciate my work in backend as a way to become more well-rounded since in outside of work I make mostly frontend web apps with [React](https://react.dev/). JavaScript is my most fluent programming language to this day and it is usually the language I interview in. At work, however, I code in Google's internal langauges and C++. My team in particular does ML infra for Google Play, which is like the Android version of the App Store. I work on Search Suggestions, which are the predictive snippets you'll see when you partially type something into a Search bar (for example, "facebook" would be suggested for "fa").

Outisde of coding I enjoy drawing and I have a [book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C9SP2DM3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
